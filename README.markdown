# Java Utilities

This is yet another project containing utilities that by rights should
arguably be included in the standard Java library, similar to the
Jakarta Commons libraries.

Rather than link to this library, I recommend you cut-and-paste the
classes into your application. Why? First, uses of these utilities will
likely be spread throughout your application. By making them your own,
you reserve the right to change your mind on the implementation later
without having to do massive changes to your code. Second, these classes
will almost certainly not contain everything you need. If you make them
your own, you can easily add utility methods where required; otherwise,
you'll have to remember to use this library for some things and your own
library for other things.
